# Flash Cards

## Abstract

This was a solo project, provided in mod 2. The project was to take a partial OOP application and make it fully functional. We were tasked with building a program that simulates quizing a user through a set of flash cards. A user can see the questions, take their guess, receive immediate answer feedback, and lastly view their final score at the end of the round.

## Setup

1. Project spec from the Turning project page [this repository](https://frontend.turing.io/projects/flash-cards.html).
2. Fork and clone down [this repository](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/flashcards-starter).
3. `cd` into your local repository.
4. Run npm install` and node index.js from the root of your project should result in the following message being displayed in your terminal: Node server running on port 3000.

*Note that you will not need to you run your server until you are instantiating your `Game` class in Iteration. Prior to that, you should be using TDD to drive your code. You should check the functionality of your application by running your tests via `npm test`.*

## Learning Goals

* Contribute code to a partially constructed object-oriented application
* Follow spec/prompts to make a working application
* Implement ES6 classes
* Write modular, reusable code that follows SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)
* Implement a robust testing suite using TDD

## Code in Action

When the game is functioning appropriately, you will be prompted for each question, have the opportunity to select an answer, and will be given feedback.
